# Stratus

The Cryptum SDK offers seamless integration with Stratus, a cutting-edge Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) executor and JSON-RPC server. Stratus stands out for its scalability solutions, built with the efficiency and reliability of Rust, and aligned with the power and efficiency of In-Memory and PostgreSQL storage solutions, making it a premier choice for developing decentralized applications (dApps). This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of how to utilize the Cryptum SDK to interact with the Stratus blockchain, covering everything from basic wallet operations to advanced smart contract interactions.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the specifics of working with Stratus through the Cryptum SDK, ensure you have the SDK installed and configured in your development environment. Refer to the official Cryptum SDK documentation for setup instructions and API details.

To get started with it, we first need to instantiate the SDK with the Stratus protocol:
```js
const sdk = new CryptumSdk({
  environment: 'testnet', // or 'mainnet'
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
});
```
Then we are ready to go!
